Description: 
The structure of the header is checksum, seq, payload size and end.
When receving a message, sender will divide data into several parts and build several packets.
When building a packet, sender will set a checksum by crc32 (which is implemented in rdt_crc.cc)
For the receiver, it will first keep data in a buffer, and when it find a packet whose end value is true,
it will start to load data into a message which will be sent to next part.
